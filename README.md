# Karpenter on Azure Kubernetes Service Workshop

Welcome to the Karpenter on AKS Workshop! 

This workshop teaches you how to implement and leverage Karpenter on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) through Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) for intelligent node scaling and resource optimization. 

The workshop is designed for DevOps engineers, Kubernetes administrators, and cloud architects looking to improve cluster scalability, application availability, and cost optimization in their AKS deployments. 

You'll gain hands-on experience configuring NodePools, working with different architectures, optimizing costs with spot instances, implementing team isolation, and applying advanced scheduling techniques to maximize the potential of your Kubernetes clusters.
